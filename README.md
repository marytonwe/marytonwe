# Hello, I’m Mary 👋  

I like to build things that make life a little bit better for everyone. My work focuses on designing systems that turn scarcity into strength — practical solutions that communities can depend on.  

Much of my work is shaped by a simple framework I call **TALS**:  

> **T**hin computing · **A**daptability · **L**ow-cost · **S**calability  

It’s a touchstone across my projects and a reminder that meaningful innovation can thrive even where resources are limited.

### 🔧 Toolkit  
I work at the intersection of **AI, Electronics, and Embedded Systems**. Some areas I’m exploring include:  

- **AI & Machine Learning** (with Reinforcement Learning)  
- **Electronics & Circuit Design**  
- **Embedded Systems & Hardware Prototyping**  
- **Sensor Integration & Communication Systems**

### 🌱 Fellow Builders, Thinkers & Dreamers  
I’m always happy to connect with people who believe technology can bring hope and opportunity. If you’re building toward a more equitable future, I’d love to share ideas and collaborate.
