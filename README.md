**👋 Hello, I’m Mary**

I like to build things that *make life a little better for everyone*. My work focuses on practical solutions communities can depend on. Much of this is guided by a framework I call **TALS**:  
**T**hin computing · **A**daptability · **L**ow-cost · **S**calability

**🔧 My Toolkit**

I work at the intersection of **AI, Electronics, and Embedded Systems**. Some areas I explore include:  
`AI & ML (with Reinforcement Learning)` · `Electronics & Circuit Design` · `Embedded Systems & Hardware Prototyping` · `Sensor Integration & Communication`

**🌱 Fellow Builders, Thinkers & Dreamers** 

I’m always happy to connect with people who believe technology can bring hope and opportunity.  
If you’re building toward a more equitable future, I’d love to share ideas and collaborate.

✨ *“Great ideas can thrive anywhere — especially where people build with purpose.”*
