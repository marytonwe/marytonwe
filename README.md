**👋 Hello, I’m Mary**

I believe the most powerful technology isn't the most complex—it's the most accessible. My work focuses on practical solutions communities can depend on. Much of this is guided by a framework from my own life's experiences called **TALS**:  **T**hin computing · **A**daptability · **L**ow-cost · **S**calability.

**🔧 My Toolkit**

I love working at the intersection of **AI, Electronics, and Embedded Systems**. Some areas I'm building in include:  
`AI & ML (including Reinforcement Learning)` · `Electronics & Circuit Design` · `Embedded Systems & Hardware Prototyping` · `Sensor Integration & Communication`

**🌱 Fellow Builders, Thinkers & Dreamers** 

I’m always excited to connect with people who believe technology can bring hope and opportunity.
If you’re building toward a more equitable future, I’d love to share ideas and collaborate.
